And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent2 in the undergrowth3.

And having perhaps the better claim5,
Because it was grassy6 and wanted wear7;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn8 them really about the same.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chanqi4444/chanqi4444.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
